            <h1>BARBERING(HAIR CUT)</h1>
           <p>Barbering is any business set up some where weather on 
               the road side or any place that people actually pass so that they would
               come and have their hair cut when it is bushy.Barbering is a very nice business for you if you only know how to
               cut hair.

                I would advice anyone who want to start this business should
                be close to a busy place,I mean place that people mostly pass.
                Also after that, you need to make barners or sign board for more
                informations.
