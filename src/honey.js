            <h1>HONEY MAKING</h1>
           <p id='pp'>Honey business is just a simple business by making boxes of wood 
               and inside it is a sugar, and placing it on trees or any place that
               can attract bees for them to come and make honey in it.
               When the box is full you go and harvest it in gentle way to avoid beating 
               by the bees.
           </p>

                <b>Factor to consider</b>
                <li>capital</li>
                <li>Nearless to bush</li>
                <li>Source of wood</li>
                <li>Nearless to market</li>
                <li>source of labour</li>
               </ul>
               <ul id='p'>
                   <b>How to advertise</b>
                   <p>After harvesting the honey you can put them in bottles
                       and send them to market.And I bet you that because of its sweetness
                       it would not last for 2hours on the market to finish,those who
                       has tasted honey before would agree with me.
                   </p>
